In order to create VMs ISO images are uploaded to the datastore. It can be done with WebUI in Storage section.

ESXi is a hypervisor system only. It itself cannot run services and route between network segments. For this purpose a service VM connected both to internal and external networks can be used.

In Hetzner console request an additional IP in order to provide external access to the setup. The IP will be provided via DHCP based on the MAC of the VM:

* Additional IP: 116.202.150.51
* Dedicated MAC: 00:50:56:00:EF:15

The server comes with 2 hard drives. The installer allocates only one to the datastore1. Expand datastore1 to the second disk: Storage -> datastore1 -> Increase capacity -> Add extent -> select disk
